Still working out a name for this :P

Essentially this will be an Android app that allows people to take a series of images over time. Whenever they feel like, they can open the stream of images they've already taken and view the changes over time.

This was inspired by me wanting to easily see how my physical change over time. "Is my hairline receding?" "Was my smile always so wrinkly?" With this app I'll be able to watch how those changes progressed over time (or know that I haven't changed at all :P ).
